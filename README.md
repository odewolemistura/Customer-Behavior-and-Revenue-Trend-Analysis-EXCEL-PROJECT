  - Power Query (for segmentation and data transformation)
  - Pivot Tables & Pivot Charts
  - Hyperlinked Shapes for Page Navigation

##  Data Cleaning & Preparation

All cleaning and transformation were done using **Power Query**:

## Key Findings & Insights

- üìà **45‚Äì59-year-olds** contribute the most to revenue  
- üëï **Clothing** is the top-performing category across all age brackets  
- üì¶ **Free and Express shipping** are more popular among male customers  
- üå∏ **Spring and Fall** have the highest purchase volumes  
- üí≥ **Credit Card and PayPal** generate the highest sales volumes  
- ‚≠ê Customers who shop **monthly** gave higher review ratings  
- ‚ùó Promo codes and discounts didn't significantly increase revenue  

## Business Recommendations

Based on the analysis, here are **strategic recommendations** to boost growth and profitability:

1. **Targeted Marketing to 30‚Äì59 Age Group**  
   These age brackets have the highest customer count and spend. Tailor ads and promotions to their needs and behaviors.

2. **Enhance Loyalty Programs for Monthly Buyers**  
   Monthly customers show higher satisfaction. Offer loyalty rewards, early access to sales, or bonus points to keep them engaged.

3. **Invest in Popular Categories**  
   Double down on high-performing products like **Clothing** and **Accessories** through seasonal promotions and personalized bundles.

4. **Streamline Preferred Shipping Options**  
   Since Free and Express shipping are popular, offer them as default options or as part of a loyalty perk.

5. **Simplify the Checkout Process**  
   Optimize for **Credit Card and PayPal** transactions, as they are the most used. Consider offering incentives for using low-cost methods like Debit or Bank Transfers.

6. **Seasonal Campaigns**  
   Launch themed campaigns in **Spring and Fall** when engagement is naturally high.

7. **Refine Discount Strategies**  
   Since discounts did not boost revenue significantly, focus more on value-driven offers (e.g., bundles, free shipping) instead of constant discounts.

8. **Grow the Subscription Base**  
   With only ~25% of customers subscribed, there‚Äôs an opportunity to build retention by promoting the benefits of membership (exclusive deals, first access, etc.).

## üßæ Final Findings / Results

This Excel dashboard provides valuable insight into customer behavior, product demand, and revenue drivers. It‚Äôs a great example of how **Excel can be used as a BI tool** to support strategic decisions without high-cost software.
